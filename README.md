# WEB_project
Zimmerim

Remember to git pull before any further work!
The website is built in a client-server architecture, where the client (web browser) interacts with the server to retrieve and display information. The administration page is accessed via the link: https://my-front-end.onrender.com/admin/login/
and login to the regular user at the link: https://my-front-end.onrender.com/
(Please wait maybe a few minutes on the pages that take information from the backend, because the server may be in sleep mode (the virtual machine) for example on the following rooms page - https://my-front-end.onrender.com/rooms)
